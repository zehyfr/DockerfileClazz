> This project aims to help you to write good Dockerfile

## General presentation

The goal of this project is to dive my advises to write Dockerfile and possibly some good ones. You will follow step by step a sequence of questions which refer to the official documentation and you will build a docker image at the end. üöÄ

## Description of the project structure

In this project, you will find:
* A frontend application VueJS in the directory `./frontend`
* A backend application Django in the directory `./backend`
* And this README

I invite you to fork this project to work on it

## Requierements to start this project

First of all, you need to install [Docker üê≥](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (If you don't want to install it locally on your computer, you can install it on virtual machine or a Cloud Provider, just keep in mind you will need this project to code).

Now clone this project to start.

## üìö Steps

The VueJS and Django applications in the project are minimalist. The goal is not to dwell on the code of the applications but to focus on the following aspects :

- Understand docker image build
- Use docker cli, Dockerfile
- Use CI to build and store your image

### üê≥ 1. Create Dockerfile for VueJS

Now create a file named `Dockerfile` in the directory `./frontend`.
Frontend app is a VueJS app, to build a VueJS app you need to:

- Use a base image named `node:lts-slim`
- Create a workspace directory named `/app`
- Copy package.json and package-lock.json (here the doc of [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/package-json.html) and [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/package-lock-json.html))
- Run `$ npm ci` to install dependancies (here the doc for [npm-ci](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html))
- Copy the whole content in frontend directory into the docker image
- Run `$ npm run build` to build the project (this command is defined into `package.json` file as `vue-cli-service build`, I let you checkout the documentation about [npm-run](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) to understand how npm scripts works)

To use a base image, you should use annotation [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from)

To create a workspace, you should use annotation [WORKDIR](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)

To copy a file from the project into the image, you should use annotation [ADD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) or [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy)

To run a command into docker image, you should use annotation [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run)

Now you have an image with all copied files before. But you just need the content of the static build directory named `dist` into `/app` that result of the command `$ npm run build`.

To keep only the important content `/app/dist`, do a [multi stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#name-your-build-stages) named `Dockerfile`. Moreover, you should render this static files with a proxy. I advise you to use this docker image `nginx:1.17-alpine` as base.

I advise you to named your different stages. Actually, you can copy the content of a build in a previous stage into another like this `COPY --from=stage-build` only if you named a previous stage like this `FROM node:lts-slim AS stage-build`. Now, copy the content of `/app/dist` into `/usr/share/nginx/html/`.

>I created for you a file named `.dockerignore` who allow, like gitignore, to omit or not, copy of file or directory into an image. You should notice that we have used a white-list system, allow only what you need.
> _TIPS: if we add `!/app/dist` in `.dockerignore` it' cause of a  multi-stage_

Now you could build the image with [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) from the root of this project. You can use this option:

- Named or tagged the image
- Specify a Dockerfile
- Specify the path of the build

<details><summary><i>SPOILER ALERT</i>: Response to build</summary>

```bash
docker build -t dockerclazz-frontend:v0.1 -f frontend/Dockerfile frontend
```
</details>

Now you could run the image with [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/). You can use this option:

- interactive
- tty
- detach
- port (on 8080:80)
- Remove automatically if stopped
- Name

<details><summary><i>SPOILER ALERT</i>: Response to run</summary>

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 --rm --name dockerize-vuejs dockerclazz-frontend
```
</details>

Now visit http://localhost:8080 (if you run on a distant server `http://<YOUR_IP>:8080`)

If you finished, execute :
```bash
docker ps -a
docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
```

### üêç 2. Create Dockerfile for Django

Now, create a file named `Dockerfile` in the directory `./backend`.
Frontend app is a Django app, to build a Django app you will need to:

- Use a base image named `python:3`
- Create a workspace directory named `/app`
- Copy `requirements.txt`
- Run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependancies
- Copy the whole content in brackend directory into the docker image
- Add an environement variable named `PORT` with default value `9090`
- Then execute the command `sh -c "/app/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:$PORT"` to run the web server at start, `sh -c` allow you to add environement variable in command

>I created a file for you named `.dockerignore` which allow, like gitignore, to omit or not, copy of file or directory into an image. You should notice that we have used a white-list system, allow only what you need.

Now, build the image with [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) from the root of this project. You can use this options:

- Named or tagged the image
- Specify a Dockerfile
- Specify the path of the build

<details><summary><i>SPOILER ALERT</i>: Response to build</summary>

```bash
docker build -t dockerclazz-backend:v0.1 -f backend/Dockerfile backend
```
</details>

Now, run the image with [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/). You can use this options:

- interactive
- tty
- detach
- environement variable with a PORT
- port (on 9090:`<PORT previously precise>`)
- Remove automatically if it's stopped
- Name

<details><summary><i>SPOILER ALERT</i>: Response to run</summary>

```bash
docker run -it -d -e PORT=9091 -p 9090:9091 --rm --name dockerize-django dockerclazz-backend
```
</details>

Then you can visit this url: http://localhost:9090/api/

If you finished, execute :
```bash
docker ps -a
docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
```
